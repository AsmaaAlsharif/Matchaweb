                        Hi! I'm Asmaaâ€”the voice, author, creative director, and web developer behind this matcha blog. To be honest, I don't even like matcha. I just love to hate, and letâ€™s face itâ€”writing about something you dislike is way more entertaining than raving about something you love. That said, Iâ€™ve had good matcha beforeâ€”so rare, in fact, that I can still recall the exact cafÃ©: Matcha Cafe Kyoto in Salt Lake City. They even serve it in adorable milk-carton-shaped containers.

<br></br> <br></br>While matcha desserts are hard to mess up, matcha drinks are a completely different story. The quality of matcha, the milk-to-tea ratio, and the texture all have to be just right. Thatâ€™s why I started this blog: matcha drinks are hit or miss, and Iâ€™m here to help you avoid wasting money on mediocre cups. From the good to the downright awful, this blog is your guide to navigating the chaotic world of matchaâ€”and trust me, there are plenty of misses to steer clear of.
                        <br></br> <br></br>
                        My standards are high and as a certified hater, when I say something is good, it's really good. Trust me, if I'm impressed, you will be too. Ultimately, my goal is to spam the site with ads and turn it into a successful venture because writing off matcha as a business expense is the American dream.

                                <p>Let's get one thing straight: I'm not about to bankrupt myself trying every single matcha variation a cafe offers.</p>

                                <p>I'm so sorry to my dairy-free bros but all my matcha drinks will be ordered with full fat whole milk because that is where the flavor is. This will also keep my reviews consistent. </p>

                        <p>I'm not even sure who reads blogs anymoreâ€”probably middle-aged, stay at home moms. No shade to them, of course, but I'm hoping some young people still remember how to read. Anyway I'm just going to use this as an excuse if it ever sounds like I'm leaning into millennial humor. Might even throw a minion meme in here somewhere. Stay tuned.</p>

                        <h3>Meaning of Matcha</h3>
                        <p>This is where other bloggers would say something corny like: "For me, matcha isn't just a drinkâ€” it's self-care. It's the thing that forces me to slow down, appreciate the moment, and live life." But, for me it's for real just a drink. The Texas Tab from Swig holds the same meaning, actually probably more.</p>
